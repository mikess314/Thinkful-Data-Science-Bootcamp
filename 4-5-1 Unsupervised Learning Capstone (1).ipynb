Since birds are a natural source of food for cats (feral) it was natural that they were instantly attracted to vol. two. Contrary to all the cartoons, cats are not fishermen, and thus, fish, either in a bowl or in the wild are not something they are naturally attracted to. Since gerbils and guinea pigs are not native where I live, they could have been little dogs as far as my cats could tell. Rodents are also a natural food, so volume one was much better than volume three.

So disgusting!  As suggested by others we doubled the dosage and so far (about six months plus) it's been working I would say about 90% of the time (that we can tell).My husband and I work long hours so they are in our side yard (about 15 x 45) for many hours by themselves with a door to the garage.  Though we walk them in the morning and then check the side yard for any deposits before we leave for work, before using this product, it was not uncommon for us to come home to dogs with horrible breath and a side yard of half-eaten piles.  We also had a dog walker come 2-3 times a week in the middle of the day to walk them again (and pick up any piles) to alleviate this problem.  However, we still ecountered this problem rather frequently.  The poor dogs really suffered for it too because we didn't want them anywhere near us at night because they smelled so disgusting.With this product, we believe that the habit has stopped, if not all the way, at least to a significant degree.  Other than I think twice in the last six months, we now come home to dogs that don't gross us out with their bad breath anymore.  And everyone is much happier for it.One more thing:  Our first dog was starting to get finicky with his food.  I don't know if this powder was to blame or if it's a supplement that we also give to him.  But what I found out works really well are those liver biscotti sprinkles.  Just adding a bit of those to the top of his dry dog food really helps with his finishing his food.  (The second dog is a food inhaler so she's got no problem with anything we give her or add to her food.)</td>\n",

So I found this SEP and was glad to see it's something mixed into their food. It does not work as well as the Distaste, but seems to discourage her. All winter I have noticed my female picking up frozen specimens and marching around the yard with them... but she doesn't seem to be eating them. I plan to double the dose, as some other reviewers have noted, and we'll see how things go through the spring. We are typically quick about cleaning up after them, particularly now that we can see the ground, but occasionally we miss a pile. I'm hoping that the problems we had this winter with the SEP not working well were maybe because the feces were frozen, and now that things are thawing, maybe the SEP will discourage her more strongly.So bottom line, it seems to be working fairly well, but has not broken the habit completely. My only other comment is the smell of the product itself. It smells like Pixie Stick dust, or something similarly sweet/sour and I find the smell really awful. My husband and two sons don't seem to mind, but I hold my breath until I get it mixed into the dogs' food.</td>\n",

       "0   I purchased the Trilogy with hoping my two cats, age 3 and 5 would be interested.  The 3 yr old cat was fascinated for about 15 minutes but when the same pictures came on, she got bored.  The 5 year old watched for about a few minutes but then walked away. It is possible that because we have a wonderful courtyard full of greenery and trees and one of my neighbors has a bird feeder, that there is enough going on outside that they prefer real life versus a taped version.  I will more than likely pass this on to a friend who has cats that don't have as much wildlife to watch as mine do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "2   I bought the triliogy and have tested out all the DVDs.  It appears that volume 2 is the most well received of the three and the one I would recommend.

I turn this on sometimes when I'm leaving the house, by the time I get home, she doesn't seem to be paying attention anymore but figured she'd at least enjoy the sounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "3   My female kitty could care less about these videos-but she cares less about almost everything. My little male however digs these. He doesn't go ape over them, but he really does watch them for a bit and it makes me feel better to throw them on when I have to go out to work and leave him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "4   If I had gotten just volume two, I would have given it five stars, but since I got the trilogy, I can only give it three stars.  I read all the reviews, and knew that vol. two was the best, hands down, but for few extra dollars I decided to get all three in a combo pack.  Since birds are a natural source of food for cats (feral) it was natural that they were instantly attracted to vol. two. Contrary to all the cartoons, cats are not fishermen, and thus, fish, either in a bowl or in the wild are not something they are naturally attracted to. Since gerbils and guinea pigs are not native where I live, they could have been little dogs as far as my cats could tell. Rodents are also a natural food, so volume one was much better than volume three. Also, the quality could have been better (for my eyes only) but my cats could care less about video quality... they just see birds..

       "5   My Rottie has food allergies to poultry, beef and dairy. I've had a difficult time finding a toothpaste that doesn't make him allergic and he enjoys the taste. This toothpaste is peanut flavor (smells like black licorice). He loves the taste and doesn't wiggle as much when I brush his teeth every night. The price is ok, but I do wish that the tube came in a larger size.

       "10  my dog like his kibbles more than treats (he LOVES to eat!!), and with this sprinkled on top of his food,he refuses to eat. the smell is super strong even I pull away my head when I open the jar.And, even when i hand fed him the food, he still tried to play with his poop.  (granted, he consumed smaller portion than the recommended by the direction)Overall, it may keep dogs away from their poop because they can smell this in their poop, but that same smell is present on their food, which obviously repells them.So, I do not recommend this product unless your dog eats EVERYTHING.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "11  This product didn't work for my dogs at all, and the smell of it was difficult to put up with (for me). It smelled like a Christmas candy cane gone all wrong. I put it in front of them on their (dry) food, I've never seen two dogs so sad to eat their food in my life. My dogs usually chow down their food really fast. Eventually I started mixing it with a bit of pumpkin to make it more tolerable for them. In the end thogh, it didn't work and my only solution seems to be keep an eye on them like a hawk when they're out (in the fenced on yard) and dispose of the poop within a minute of it hitting the ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "13  I bought this product to stop the problem we were having with our 6 month old puppy. We have 5 little dogs that are paper trained. The product smells horrible to me, enough to make my stomach turn. I mixed it with canned food and all but one dog really loved it. I forced myself to tolerate the smell and continued to feed it to them for a couple of weeks once a day. It has helped to stop the problem even though one dog wouldn't eat it. I have stopped it for about a week now and it still seems to be working. I have my fingers crossed because I really don't want to smell it as I feed it anymore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "15  Tried a couple other products before this, but this the only one that has worked.  I have two dogs and the second one started this habit and taught it to our first dog.  So disgusting!  As suggested by others we doubled the dosage and so far (about six months plus) it's been working I would say about 90% of the time (that we can tell).My husband and I work long hours so they are in our side yard (about 15 x 45) for many hours by themselves with a door to the garage.  Though we walk them in the morning and then check the side yard for any deposits before we leave for work, before using this product, it was not uncommon for us to come home to dogs with horrible breath and a side yard of half-eaten piles.  We also had a dog walker come 2-3 times a week in the middle of the day to walk them again (and pick up any piles) to alleviate this problem.  However, we still ecountered this problem rather frequently.  The poor dogs really suffered for it too because we didn't want them anywhere near us at night because they smelled so disgusting.With this product, we believe that the habit has stopped, if not all the way, at least to a significant degree.  Other than I think twice in the last six months, we now come home to dogs that don't gross us out with their bad breath anymore.  And everyone is much happier for it.One more thing:  Our first dog was starting to get finicky with his food.  I don't know if this powder was to blame or if it's a supplement that we also give to him.  But what I found out works really well are those liver biscotti sprinkles.  Just adding a bit of those to the top of his dry dog food really helps with his finishing his food.  (The second dog is a food inhaler so she's got no problem with anything we give her or add to her food.)   \n",
       "16  We added a two-year old corgi to our family in August. She'd been living in multi-dog households (meaning four dogs or more) for her entire life. We just have one other dog, her brother. She immediately began ingesting feces from both her and her brother. I'm not sure if this is a habit from living with many other dogs or was brought on by the stress of being in a new home, but I was determined to stop it.We tried a product from Drs. Foster and Smith called Distaste and it worked quite well, but my male dog wasn't terribly thrilled with it-- it came in chew form and he didn't seem to like them. So I found this SEP and was glad to see it's something mixed into their food. It does not work as well as the Distaste, but seems to discourage her. All winter I have noticed my female picking up frozen specimens and marching around the yard with them... but she doesn't seem to be eating them. I plan to double the dose, as some other reviewers have noted, and we'll see how things go through the spring. We are typically quick about cleaning up after them, particularly now that we can see the ground, but occasionally we miss a pile. I'm hoping that the problems we had this winter with the SEP not working well were maybe because the feces were frozen, and now that things are thawing, maybe the SEP will discourage her more strongly.So bottom line, it seems to be working fairly well, but has not broken the habit completely. My only other comment is the smell of the product itself. It smells like Pixie Stick dust, or something similarly sweet/sour and I find the smell really awful. My husband and two sons don't seem to mind, but I hold my breath until I get it mixed into the dogs' food.                                                                               \n",
       "17  Works really well--not 100% of the time, but most of the time.  I spend much of my time outdoors picking up dog poop from my 2 dogs, so I can tell this is really working.  I liked it so well, I bought a replacement when the first jar ran out.  Would recommend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

Neither really caught particles circulating tank. Neither fine enough media capture everything, recirculated fine stuff. Adding polishing filter 350 reduced water flow substantially resulted expensive blocked filter element garbage days, provide sort long term solution.Am looking move bigger tank, something like 120-200 gallons current 65, I willing consider filters would overkill. If thing. I looking FX5 time discounted large. Reading reviews I saw although headline flow rate 925gph rate drops like 600gph stuffed media. Well that\\'s unreasonable 65 gallon tank. Finally, last Sunday I moved things tank ended cloudy again. I disturbed gravel add plants particles would floating around ages. The combination gravel filter mechanical filter catching fine material. Short washing gravel I lot options.So I ordered FX5 Monday. By Tuesday afternoon delivered, much 2nd day delivery, took less 24 hours cross half country.I thought A218 kit FX5 plus pre-filter biomax media, mentioned I also ordered fine filter, polishing filter two boxes media.Assembling filter body easy. I took lid removed filter stack washed foam blocks replaced them. I rinsed pre-filter biomax material added top bottom baskets. I also added media bag full carbon biomax. In middle I added stack fine mechanical filters, I put polishing pad bottom, hand cut two pieces phosphate ammonia absorbing material I hand middle added fine pad top. I re-stacked baskets returned housing. After adding 2 gallons water give pump something work on, stated instructions, I put lid back secured it.The supplied pipe enough normal installations, though said I ended discarding two feet. But tank stand fairly tall, probably 5\\'6\" floor rim. I attached two cut-off valves pipe connected filter intended location. I ran pipes would enter tank cut required length. I clipped tank lip fixtures jammed inlet outlet end. The bottom inlet pipe two suction cups keep place, I secured inside tank.OK. Ready go. When I plugged filter began slowly pumping mixture water fine bubbles. Oh... that\\'s I hoped for. But said needed prime I expect 3 gallons air body, let\\'s leave see happens. A minutes later stopped making noise bubbles, moments later belched stream bubbles water level dropped inches. Ah. So that\\'s priming. A minutes later, one final large bubble, filter started real. No bubbles sound I could hear PC.At point tank soupy mess. I taken opportunity clean filters pump heads disturbed lot fine particles filters would caught. Ten minutes later seemed improving. An hour later much sign anything floating water. This morning tank crystal clear.In summary filter works way should. The pump bottom, get noisy cavitate air system, bubbles present mostly sit foot pump top housing cause problems. Even allowed daily purge.One side fish eat I feed filter will.There real sides setup. When full water heavy provide two ways drain servicing. The pipes fit together well joints seal properly. The valves connectors easy operate. The main pipe connectors double \\'O\\' ring seal. The area first level filtration huge, basically inlet water flows round outside stack three baskets filters towards core. Once foam filters flows top container sucked three media baskets. At bottom sucked pump drives outlet. There\\'s way significant amount water pass unfiltered.Loaded way I flow rate maybe 600gph. That much size tank, though lot people use. The fish problems finding relatively quiet spot, there\\'s lot less chance things actually stagnating used old units.I considered Eheim 2080.

    "Let's take a look at a few of these. Starting with the reviews assigned to cluster 0. The first one is clearly about a cat's litter box. The next one is about a dish that might have been meant for a dog but would work for a cat better. And that is still about some kind of vessel or container that works for a cat. The third cluster 0 review is about cat food, particularly a special blend that helps manage a cat's medical conditions. it's not about a container of any kind. But it does illustrate how the cat3 enjoys (can toerate) the food. \n",

But the review is written more from the perspective of the owner's value of the product, not the dog's use. I think it may be on the edge, but is still appropriately assigned. \n",

    "I am satisfied with this clustering for its ability to determine the subject of the review. But how does it help with predicting the author of the review? Each of the ten authors are presumably American English speakers with a common vernacular. The author is going to be very difficult to predict. However, the subject of the review is altogether different. I've shown that I can cluster the training set around specific content, like dog food and fish supplies. And the column 'asin' is the inventory classifier for a particular product. I expect that if I integrate my clustering back into my vectorized matrix I can run supervised learning models that predict the class of product. "

All takes one good splash short system - mention void warrantee.The unit incredibly thin, trouble fitting canopy top tank. The lights rest 1/4 inch glass tops - course want place back. The end brackets fully adjustable make perfect, snap fit. However, I suggest using size smaller tanks, say 40 gallon ignore brackets position unit without brackets extended dead center glass versa top.The reason go nuts trying get system perfectly centered. In addition look without brackets extended sensational, clean high tech.There's lot bang buck :* The day light LED lights consume 35 watts opposed 80 single fluorescent bulb.* The Lunar LED lights spectacular - allow watch fish without disturbing natural sleep/rest cycle.* Each LED covered Polycarbonate lens - protects bulb, helps create \"shimmer effect\" hobbyists raving about.* Everything need controlled single side switch.

       "8  I \"5 Gal Repitat Reptile Habitat\" I house young Snake in. This light canopy fits great top. The thing I noticed, didnt give 5 stars, level. There 3 small pillars allow lock place using exo terra terrariums. You sort see picture. The lack forth one makes uneven flat surface. You I put adhesive chair leg pad solves problem, I show picture I added. But aware level need be.Also description says \"Use Exo Terra compact fluorescent (max 26W) incandescent (max 40W) light bulbs\".But box manual says incandescent (MAX 25W). Just something aware using incandescent bulbs.I think mentions description either unit used dimmer. It states manual comes it.

       "9  I've keeping fish thirty five years - wonderfully innovative double bright LED lighting systems best advances I've seen aquarium lighting.I impressed largest sized units - 48-60 I 55 gallons way 125 gallons ( need Double uo units larger tanks avoid shadow ensure uniform lighting)This size perfect tanks 36\" across, regular breeder tank results absolutely stunning.Gone dull white haze expensive, energy draining full spectrum tubes. Not mention awfully shoddy fixtures changed least since I kid 40 years ago.Having looked alternative lighting past, setups either expensive, ran hot difficult install.One thing certain Marineland hit hands. The unit simplicity itself. A sleek smart design - functional beautiful. Solid build quality, need special wiring - installation breeze. Simply place glass canopy, turn get ready jaw drop.The light unit nothing short gorgeous, pours crystal, pristine brilliant. The \"shimmering effect\" subtle really quite remarkable - Lunar mode almost surreal beautiful.I've read forums folks using lights without versa top. All takes one good splash short system - mention void warrantee.The unit incredibly thin, trouble fitting canopy top tank. The lights rest 1/4 inch glass tops - course want place back. The end brackets fully adjustable make perfect, snap fit. However, I suggest using size smaller tanks, say 40 gallon ignore brackets position unit without brackets extended dead center glass versa top.The reason go nuts trying get system perfectly centered. In addition look without brackets extended sensational, clean high tech.There's lot bang buck :* The day light LED lights consume 35 watts opposed 80 single fluorescent bulb.* The Lunar LED lights spectacular - allow watch fish without disturbing natural sleep/rest cycle.* Each LED covered Polycarbonate lens - protects bulb, helps create \"shimmer effect\" hobbyists raving about.* Everything need controlled single side switch. Daylight, Lunar off.Nothing I've seen re-creates look actual sunlight perfectly - spectacular.You get impressive 17,000 lifetime hours, Daylight mode, Lunar mode, incredible Shimmer effect that's bound knock - whopping 1800 Lumens clear, clean light. The Marineland Double Bright LED lighting system exceptional.Once turn know immediately system worth every penny. Just brilliant product - meet expectations, exceeds them.   \n",

Using K-Means, I was able to dial in my number of clusters, assuming 10 to start because of the number of authors, then reduced to 5 for the most distinct categorization of the subject of those reviews. \n",

    "I tried to model for the asin, the inventory control number for the specific product. But this ran into a problem somewhat opposite of the issue with the authors. For the authors, I did indeed have 10 to categorize. But they were so similar in their vernacular, and their individual reviews so short that there is very little chance I can predict who is talking about a certain kind of chew toy based on the language used. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the asins were so many and had so few assigned to each that it made it impossible to categorize. I considered researching the format to see if it was categorical. But there were several formats to the asin. \n",

    "Instead I created clusters for the content of the reviews, which feels much more unsupervise anyway. So modeling to the clusters with supervised learning models was the right way to go. And I see that I can use this method to greatly expand the reviews to the entire Pet Supply department, maybe even other departments. Why not, if the Unsupervised Learning clustering methods are able to separate them by content. It's just a matter of choosingn clusters and tuning parameters. "
